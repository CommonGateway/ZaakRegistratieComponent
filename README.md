## Creating your own documentation
This Commmon Gateway configuration repository is bassed on [petstore](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/) an example [Open API Specification]([https://redocly.com/docs/openapi/reference-docs-example/overview/](https://swagger.io/specification/)) from our friends at [redocly](https://redocly.com/docs/). In order to create and maintain Open Api Secifications files we recomend using [stoplight](), you can find the stoplight project for Pet Store [here](https://conduction.stoplight.io/docs/pet-store/branches/main/ls7mp80wwy88k-swagger-petstore). For convience purpose a copy of the Pet strore oas is stored in this repository [here](https://github.com/CommonGateway/ZaakRegistratieComponent/blob/main/OAS.yaml).

The [public code](https://yml.publiccode.tools/) for this ropository was genereted trough the [publiccode yaml editor](https://publiccode-editor.developers.italia.it/).
